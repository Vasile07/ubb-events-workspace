Source task 4 — Base UI components: actions and form fields

**Description:** Implement the reusable components from page `Design System`, section `Components` (2:2):
- `Button` (variants Primary, Secondary, Ghost, Danger; sizes Md 44px and Sm 34px; node 2:20) with `loading` and `disabled` states and optional leading icon
- `Badge` (tones Neutral, Info, Success, Warning, Danger, Brand with the leading dot; node 2:40)
- `TextField` (states Default, Focus, Error; label, helper/error text; node 2:57) plus a `TextArea` variant with the same look and configurable height
- `Select` styled like TextField with a chevron
- `SearchField` (pill, search icon; node 2:59)
- `FilterChip` (Default/Active with chevron; node 2:72)

All must forward refs, support keyboard focus (focus ring uses `border/focus`), `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby`. Add a demo page (or Storybook) showing every variant.
**Depends on:** 2.
