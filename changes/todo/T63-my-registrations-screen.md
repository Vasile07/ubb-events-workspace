## Description


<!-- What needs to be done and why. Which user need does it address? -->

Source task 16 — My registrations screen

**Description:** Implement page `Student Screens`, frame `My registrations` (14:355): pill tabs Active / Canceled / Past with counts, info banner and rows (date block, title, organization, location, date/time, status badge, actions).
Data from `GET /api/users/me/registrations` (only the user's own, active and cancelled).
Actions:
- View event
- Cancel registration (confirmation, then `DELETE`) on active rows
- Register again on canceled rows whose event has not started (re-register reactivates the row)
- no actions on completed events

Empty state per tab, see frame `My registrations – empty` (48:829, EmptyState Ticket with "Discover events"). Loading and error states.
**Depends on:** 6, 15.

## Human Corrections

<!--
Evidence of human oversight.
Agents add an entry ONLY when the user points out a problem or requests a change,
in the user's own terms. Never on the agent's own initiative.
